# DTC UEQ (Upper Extremity Quantifier) Project

All code is being run on an Arduino Uno R3 and outputted onto a 16x2 LCD Display using bathroom scale load sensors connected to an hx711.


Code is commented fairly well. Use this sketch to calibrate your scale - https://gist.github.com/matt448/14d118e2fc5b6217da11
